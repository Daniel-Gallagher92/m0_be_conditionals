# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- Conditionals are useful when you have more than one possible outcome
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would not have taken a little break so I could have figured out the spicy challenge, ugh!! Out of time!
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- Focusing on creating files above the directory they are being created in has been satisfying to practice. Also, using irb to test quick small lines of code, as well as replit for longer code snippets that I need to change the value of variables to test all conditions. This is great instead of rewriting the entire code just to change the value of a variable. This made me feel like I am working smarter, and saving my cognitive energy! WooHoo!
